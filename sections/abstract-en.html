<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Digital Construction Entities (DICE) ontology defines the basic terms useful to represent digitalized construction processes (utilizing BIM, IoT, mobile devices, ERP, and so on) and modern construction management methods and practices developed in the field of lean construction. The purpose is to enable the representation of connections between data objects produced by different digital systems. DICE uses the ISO BFO (ISO/IEC 21838-2) as its top-level ontology, and it is organized according to the fundamental categories of BFO. Moreover, an attempt has been made to adapt representational ideas from other ontologies closely related to BFO to enable the future harmonization of DICE with relevant developments.
