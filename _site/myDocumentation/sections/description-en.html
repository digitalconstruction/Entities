To capture the dynamic and interlinked nature of construction
processes, activity (<tt>dice:Activity</tt>) is the central concept in the Digital
Construction Entities ontology. Different aspects of construction
process are associated with activity. Activities themselves can form
complex hierarchies (work breakdown structures) where they are linked
to each other through relations
<tt>dice:hasSubActivity/dice:subActivityOf</tt>. In addition
to that, activities are connected with different activity
ingredients and aspects are shown in the figure below.

The different activity ingredients are connected to Activity through
the relations shown in the figure below. The relations are
specializations of the <tt>participant</tt> relation defined in BFO.
